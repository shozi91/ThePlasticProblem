                        The plastics problem has been growing exponentially for decades. In 1967, less than 25 million tons were produced each year. Yet by 1980,
                        production had doubled. Ten years later, it doubled again to 100 million tons, surpassing the amount of
                        steel produced globally. Today, the plastics industry, estimated to be worth more than $4 trillion,
                        generates more than 300 million tons of plastic a year according to the most recent records —
                        nearly half of which is for single-use items, meaning that it will almost instantly become trash.
