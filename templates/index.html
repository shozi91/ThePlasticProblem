        <br><br>
        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">
            Humanity has a problem. Pollution. We're addicted to it.

            One of the largest contributors to this addiction is our love of plastics and the convenience it presents to us in our daily lives. 
    
            Plastics are used in construction and medical equipment. One might say this would be the 'good' which plastics can bring.
    
            Plastics are also used to neatly package items we consume each and every day. 
    
            We even use plastics to carry around these neatly packaged items.
    
            Plastics provide much of humanity a sense of entitlement, as it becomes more ingrained in our lives. Plastics have made us lazy.
    
            <br><br>
            
            What happens when we become lazy? What happens to the plastic after we finish that sandwich? That bottle of water? That straw we use?
    
            It ends up in our creeks, streams, rivers, and oceans.

                        You might be saying to me, "hold on just a second, seemingly judgemental individual berating me about my use of plastics. What does any of this have to do with me? I recycle!"
                        
                        You're right to push back, but at the same time, regardless of the stout contribution you've made to our communities and world by recycling and playing your role, 
                        there's still much of the world who may not know of this baffling situation humankind has put itself and Earth in. 
                        
                        No matter how detrimental the situation may seem, we as a collective species continue to produce, consume, and waste plastics like there's no tomorrow.

                        <br><br>

                        The plastic problem has been growing exponentially for decades. 
                        
                        Back in the 1960s, we produced less than 25,000,000 tons of plastic each year.

                        Within the next 20 years, production reached 50,000,000 tons of plastic each year. 

                        By the 1990s, we allowed the production of plastic to double again, reaching 100,000,000 tons. Let's just stop here for just a moment, and think about what this number means.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        The majestic Empire State building has a weight of 350,000 tons. With the amount of plastic made in 1990, we could have built the Empire State building 285 times!
                        
                        <br><br>

                        Zip forward another 20 years to 2010, where 300,000,000 tons of plastic is made each year.
                        
                        Nearly half of this plastic is made for single-use items, like straws, water bottles, and Twinkie wrappers.

                        Essentially the items you and I could think of that we could identify as trash.

                        I've thought of a 1,000 ways to best describe how plastics enter our oceans, and surprisingly it's harder to do this than explaining to my niece where babies come from.

                        So instead, I'm going to bow out and let Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (authors of the <u><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution">article</a></u> which the excerpt below has been extracted from) do it for me.
                        
                        Don't worry, I'll provide proper citation down below.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Plastic enters the oceans from coastlines, rivers, tides, and marine sources. But once it is there, where does it go?
                        
                        The distribution and accumulation of ocean plastics is strongly influenced by oceanic surface currents and wind patterns. Plastics are typically buoyant – meaning they float on the ocean surface - allowing them to be transported by the prevalent wind and surface current routes. 
                        
                        As a result, plastics tend to accumulate in oceanic gyres, with high concentrations of plastics at the centre of ocean basins, and much less around the perimeters.
                        
                        After entry to oceans from coastal regions, plastics tend to migrate towards the centre of ocean basins.

                            I've made the situation so far, sound as if it were purely doom and gloom. Don't get me wrong, it's a very real problem.

                            But what I've failed to mention thus far, is the credit that is due to the organizations, teams, and individuals out there who are actually doing something to help solve our problems.
